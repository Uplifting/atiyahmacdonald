\subsection{Problem}
Let $x$ be a nilpotent element of a ring $A$. Show that $1 + x$ is a unit of  $A$. Deduce that the sum of a nilpotent element and a unit is a unit.

\subsection{Solution}
Note the identity $\left(\sum_{i = 0}^k x_i \right) (1-x) =  1- x^{k+1}$. Since $x$ is nilpotent,  $x^l = 0$ for some $l \geq 1$. Thus, if we set $k = l-1$ in the identity above, we see that $1-x$ has a multiplicative inverse, and is therefore  a unit. 

To prove the original statement, given that $x$ is a nilpotent unit, it is clear that $-x$ is nilpotent as well, and by the logic above, $1 - (-x) = 1 + x$ is a unit, as desired.

Suppose $u$ is an arbitrary unit. Since $x$ is nilpotent, $u^{-1}x$ is nilpotent as well, so by the above, $u^{-1}x + 1$ is a unit. Since the product of units is a unit, $u(u^{-1}x + 1) = x + u$ is a unit, as desired.

Let $A$ be a ring and let $A[x]$ be the ring of polynomials in an indeterminate $x$, with coefficients in $A$. Let $f = a_0 + a_1x + \cdots + a_n x^n \in A[x]$. Prove that

i) $f$ is a unit in $A[x] \Leftrightarrow a_0$ is a unit in $A$ and $a_1, \ldots, a_n$ are nilpotent. 

ii) $f$ is nilpotent $\Leftrightarrow a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_n$ are nilpotent.

iii) $f$ is a zero-divisor $\Leftrightarrow$ there exists $a \neq 0$ in $A$ such that $af = 0$.

iv) $f$ is said to be primitive if $(a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_n) = (1)$. Prove that if $f,g \in A[x]$, then $fg$ is primitive $\Leftrightarrow f$ and $g$ are primitive.

\subsection{Problem}
Let $K$ be a field and let $\Sigma$ be the set of all irreducible monic polynomials $f$ in one indeterminate with coefficients in $K$. Let $A$ be the polynomial ring over $K$ generated by indeterminates $x_f$, one for each $f \in \Sigma$. Let $\mathfrak{a}$ be the ideal of $A$ generated by the polynomials $f(x_f)$ for all $f \in \Sigma$. Show that $\mathfrak{a} \neq (1)$.

Let $\mathfrak{m}$ be the maximal ideal of $A$ containing $\mathfrak{a}$, and let $K_1 = A/\mathfrak{m}$. Then $K_1$ is an extension field of $K$ in which each $f \in \Sigma$ has a root. Repeat the construction with $K_1$ in place of K, obtaining a field $K_2$, and so on. Let $L = \cup_{n=1}^{\infty} K_n$. Then $L$ is a field in which each $f \in \Sigma$ splits completely into linear factors. Let $\bar{K}$ be the set of all elements of $L$ which are algebraic over $K$.

\subsection{Problem}
Show that $\left( \mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z} \right) \otimes_{\mathbb{Z}}  \left( \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z} \right) = 0$ if $m,n$ are coprime.
\subsection{Solution}
The tensor product is generated by all possible tensor products of pairs of generators from the two rings we are tensoring. Both rings are cyclic and are generated by 1. So the tensor product is generated by $1 \otimes 1$.  Now, note that $m (1 \otimes 1) = m \otimes 1 = 0 \otimes 1 = 0$, and $n (1 \otimes 1) = 1 \otimes n = 1 \otimes 0 = 0$. Thus, the order of $1 \otimes 1$ must divide both $m$ and $n$. However, since $m$ and $n$ are coprime, the only such positive number is 1. Thus, $1 \otimes 1$ has order 1, so $\left( \mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z} \right) \otimes_{\mathbb{Z}}  \left( \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z} \right)$ is a ring that contains only one element, which is therefore 0, as desired.

\subsection{Problem}
Let $A$ be a ring, $\mathfrak{a}$ an ideal, $M$ an $A$-module. Show that $(A/\mathfrak{a}) \otimes_{A} M$ is isomorphic to $M/\mathfrak{a}M$.

\subsection{Solution}
Consider the exact sequence $0 \rightarrow \mathfrak{a} \rightarrow A \rightarrow A/\mathfrak{a} \rightarrow 0$. We now tensor this with $M$ to get $0 \rightarrow \mathfrak{a} \otimes_{A} M \rightarrow A \otimes_{A} M \rightarrow A/\mathfrak{a} \otimes_{A} M \rightarrow 0$. By the first isomorphism theorem, we therefore have that $A/\mathfrak{a} \otimes_{A} M \cong A \otimes_{A} M / \mathfrak{a} \otimes_A M$. Clearly, $A \otimes_A M \cong M$ and $\mathfrak{a} \otimes_{A} M \cong \mathfrak{a} M$, so we have $A/\mathfrak{a} \otimes_{A} M \cong M/\mathfrak{a}M$, as desired.

\section{}

\subsection{Problem}
Let $A$ be a local ring, $M$ and $N$ finitely generated $A$-modules. Prove that if $M \otimes N = 0$, then $M = 0$ or $N = 0$.

\subsection{Solution}
Let $\mathfrak{m}$ be the maximal ideal of $A$ and let $k = A/\mathfrak{m}$ be the residue field. Then $M_k = k \otimes_A M \cong M/\mathfrak{m}M$ by 3.2. Since $A$ is a local ring, $\mathfrak{m}$ is the only maximal ideal of $A$, so by Nakayama's lemma, if $M_k = 0$, then $M = 0$. 

Since $M \otimes_{A} N = 0$, $(M \otimes_{A} N)_k = M_k \otimes_{A} N_k = 0$. Since $M_k$ and $N_k$ are both vector spaces over a field, this implies that either $M_k = 0$ or $N_k = 0$, which implies that either $M = 0$ or $N= 0$, as desired.

\section{}
\subsection{Problem}
Let $M_i (i \in I)$ be any family of $A$-modules, and let $M$ be their direct sum. Prove that $M$ is flat $\Leftrightarrow$ each $M_i$ is flat.

\subsection{Solution}
$\Rightarrow:$ Suppose that $M$ is flat. The maximal ideals of $M$ are $\{\times_{i \neq j} M_i  \times \mathfrak{m}_j | j \in I, \mathfrak{m_j} \in M_j\}$, where $\mathfrak{m}_j$ are the maximal ideals of $M_j$. The quotients of all these maximal ideals must also be flat. These are all $M_j/\mathfrak{m}_j$, over all $j \in I$ and over all $\mathfrak{m}_j$ which are maximal in $M_j$. For a specific $j$, this implies that all the maximal ideals are flat. This implies that $M_j$ is flat. So this direction is done.

$\Leftarrow:$ Just go the other direction.

\subsection{Problem}
Let $A[x]$ be the ring of polynomials in one indeterminate over a ring $A$. Prove that $A[x]$ is a flat $A$-algebra.
\subsection{Solution}



\section{}
\subsection{Problem}
For any $A$-module, let $M[x]$ denote the set of all polynomials in $x$ with coefficients in $M$, that is to say expressions of the form \[m_0 + m_1x + \cdots + m_rx^r (m_t \in M)\]

Defining the product of an element of $A[x]$ and an element of $M[x]$ in the obvious way, show that $M[x] \cong A[x] \otimes_{A} M$.

\subsection{Solution}
From Proposition 2.14, we know that $(M + N) \otimes P \cong (M \otimes P) + (N \otimes P)$. We can consider $M[x]$ to be an infinite direct sum of $M$, and $A[x]$ to be an infinite direct sum of $A$. From Proposition 2.14, we know that when $M$ is a module of $A$, $A \otimes M \cong M$. These two facts immediately imply the desired conclusion, $M[x] \cong A[x] \otimes_A M$.


\section{}
\subsection{Problem}
Let $\mathfrak{p}$ be a prime ideal of $A$. Show that $\mathfrak{p}[x]$ is a prime ideal in $A[x]$.

\subsection{Solution}
Let $f,g \in A[x] - \mathfrak{p}[x]$. Let \[f = a_0 + a_1x + a_2x^2 + \cdots a_n x^n\] and let \[g = b_0 + b_1 x + b_2 x^2 + \cdots + b_m x^m\]

Suppose $a_i$ is the coefficient with smallest index that is not in $\mathfrak{p}$, and let $b_j$ be defined likewise. These must both exist because $f,g \notin \mathfrak{p}[x]$. Then consider the coefficient of $x^{i+j}$ in $fg$. WLOG, let $i < j$. Then the coefficient of $x^{i+j}$ in $fg$ is \[\sum_{r = 0}^{i-1} a_r b_{i+j-r} + a_i b_j + \sum_{s = 0}^{j-1} a_{i+j-s}b_s\]

Both the sums are in $\mathfrak{p}$ because $a_r \in \mathfrak{p}$ for $r < i$ and $b_s \in \mathfrak{p}$ for $s < j$, by the definitions of $i$ and $j$. But $a_i$ and $b_j$ are not in $\mathfrak{p}$, and $\mathfrak{p}$ is prime, so $a_i b_j$ is not in $\mathfrak{p}$. Thus, $fg$ is not in $\mathfrak{p}[x]$. Thus, $\mathfrak{p}[x]$ is prime in $A[x]$, as desired.

\subsection{Problem}

i) If $M$ and $N$ are flat $A$-modules, then so is $M \otimes_{A} N $.

ii) If $B$ is a flat $A$-algebra and $N$ is a flat $B$-module, then $N$ is flat as an $A$-module.

\subsection{Solution}

i) Let $0 \rightarrow B \rightarrow C \rightarrow D \rightarrow 0$ be an exact sequence of $A$-modules. Since $M$ is flat, \[0 \rightarrow B \otimes_A M \rightarrow C \otimes_A M \rightarrow D \otimes_A M \rightarrow 0\] is exact. Since $N$ is flat, 
\[0 \rightarrow (B \otimes_A M) \otimes_A N \rightarrow (C \otimes_A M) \otimes_A N \rightarrow (D \otimes_A M) \otimes_A N \rightarrow 0\] is also exact. By Proposition 2.14, $(M \otimes N) \otimes P \cong M \otimes (N \otimes P)$, so therefore we have 
\[0 \rightarrow B \otimes_A (M \otimes_A N) \rightarrow C \otimes_A (M \otimes_A N) \rightarrow D \otimes_A (M \otimes_A N) \rightarrow 0\] is exact. Thus, $M \otimes_A N$ is flat, as desired.

ii) Let $0 \rightarrow C \rightarrow D \rightarrow E \rightarrow 0$ be an exact sequence of $A$-modules. Since $B$ is a flat $A$-algebra, \[0 \rightarrow C \otimes_A B \rightarrow D \otimes_A B \rightarrow E \otimes_A B \rightarrow 0\] is exact. Since $N$ is a flat $B$-module, \[0 \rightarrow C \otimes_A B \otimes_B N \rightarrow D \otimes_A B \otimes_B N \rightarrow E \otimes_A B \otimes_B N \rightarrow 0\] 

But $B \otimes_B N \cong N$, so we get 
 \[0 \rightarrow C \otimes_A  N \rightarrow D \otimes_A N \rightarrow E \otimes_A  N \rightarrow 0\] 

which implies that $N$ is flat as an $A$-module, as desired.
\section{}
\subsection{Problem}
Let $0 \rightarrow M' \rightarrow M \rightarrow M'' \rightarrow 0$ be an exact sequence of $A$-modules. If $M'$ and $M''$ are finitely generated, then so is $M$.

\subsection{Solution}
Let $u_1, u_2, \cdots, u_m$ be the generators of $M'$ and let $v_1, v_2, \cdots v_n$ be the generators of $M''$. Let $w_i = f(u_i), 1 \leq i \leq m$. Since $M$ surjects onto $M''$, for each of the $v_i$, there is an $x_i$ such that $f(x_i) = v_i$.

Let $f$ be the map from $M$ to $M''$ in the exact sequence. For each $m \in M$, either $m$ goes to 0 or $f(m)$ is a finite sum $s_1 v_1 + s_2 v_2 + \cdots + s_n v_n$. In the first case, it is in the submodule generated by $w_1, w_2, \cdots, w_m$. In the second case, it is in the submodule generated by $x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_n$. In all cases, $m$ is in the submodule generated by $w_1, w_2, \cdots, w_m, x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_n$. Thus $M$ is finitely generated as desired.

Let $A$ be a ring, $\mathfrak{a}$ an ideal contained in the Jacobson radical of $A$; let $M$ be an $A$-module and $N$ a finitely generated $A$-module, and let $u: M \rightarrow N$ be a homomorphism.

Let $A$ be a ring $\neq 0$. Show that $A^m \cong A^n \Rightarrow m = n$.

\subsection{Solution}
Let $\mathfrak{m}$ be a maximal ideal of $A$, let $k = A/\mathfrak{m}$, and let $\phi: A^m \rightarrow A^n$ be an isomorphism. Then $1 \otimes_k \phi: k \otimes_k A^m \rightarrow k \otimes_k A^n$ is an isomorphism of vector spaces of dimensions $m$ and $n$. Thus, $m = n$.

\section{}
Let $M$ be a finitely generated $A$-module and $\phi: M \rightarrow A^n$ a surjective homomorphism. Show that Ker $(\phi)$ is finitely generated.

\section{Solution}
Ker $(\phi) \subset M$ and $M$ is finitely generated, so Ker $(\phi)$ must be finitely generated.

\subsection{Problem}
Let $f: A \rightarrow B$ be a ring homomorphism, and let $N$ be a $B$-module. Regarding $N$ as an $A$-module by restriction of scalars, form the $B$-module $N_B = B \otimes_A N$. Show that the homomorphism $g: N \rightarrow N_B$ which maps $y$ to $1 \otimes y$ is injective and that $g(N)$ is a direct summand of $N_B$.

\subsection{Problem}
Let $S$ be a multiplicatively closed subset of a ring $A$, and let $M$ be a finitely generated $A$-module. Prove that $S^{-1}M = 0$ if and only if there exists $s \in S$ such that $sM = 0$.

\subsection{Solution}
$\Leftarrow$: Let $m/t \in S^{-1}M$. Now note that $m/t  = 0/1 \Leftrightarrow mu = 0$ for some $u \in S$. But since $sM = 0$, $ms = 0$ for all $m \in M$, so setting $u = s$ establishes that $m/t = 0$, so $S^{-1}M = 0$.

$\Rightarrow$: Suppose that $S^{-1}M = 0$. Then for all $m/1 \in S^{-1}M$, we have $m/1 = 0/1$, so there exists a $u \in S$ such that $mu = 0$. Let $e_1, e_2, \cdots, e_n$ be the generators of $M$. Let their corresponding annihilators in $S$ be $u_1, u_2, \cdots, u_n$. Then $u_1 u_2 \cdots u_n$ annihilates every element of $M$. Thus, we are done.
