\section{}
Let $x$ be a nilpotent element of a ring $A$. Show that $1 + x$ is a unit of  $A$. Deduce that the sum of a nilpotent element and a unit is a unit.

Note the identity $\left(\sum_{i = 0}^k x_i \right) (1-x) =  1- x^{k+1}$. Since $x$ is nilpotent,  $x^l = 0$ for some $l \geq 1$. Thus, if we set $k = l-1$ in the identity above, we see that $1-x$ has a multiplicative inverse, and is therefore  a unit.
